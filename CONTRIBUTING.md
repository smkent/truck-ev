## Development documentation

### Prerequisites

- [x] A [supported version][python-versions] of [**Python**][python]
- [x] [**git** for verson control][git]
- [x] [Astral's **uv** Python project manager][uv]: `pip install uv` or
  [other supported method][uv-installation]
- [x] [**Copier**][copier]: `uv tool install copier`
- [x] [Poe the Poet][poethepoet] (recommended): `uv tool install poethepoet`

    This provides `poe` without the `uv run` prefix,
    e.g. `poe test` instead of `uv run poe test`

### Project development workflow

#### Cloning the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/smkent/truck-ev
cd truck-ev
```

Run `poe setup` in new repository clones to enable git hooks:

```sh
poe setup  # Enables git hooks
```

#### Development tools

* `poe lint`: Run formatters and static checks
* `poe test`: Run tests

The `lint` and `test` tasks can also be run as a single combined command with:

```sh
poe lt
```

### Test snapshots

Some tests compare test results with saved snapshots. Test snapshots can be
updated by running:

```sh
poe snapup
```

### Applying copier-python template updates

Copier can update your project with template changes that have occurred since
the project was created.

To apply updates, simply run in your project directory:

```sh
copier update
```

This will repeat the setup prompts, in case any prompts have been added or
changed.

!!! tip
    To change template-provided features in your project, simply change your
    answers in the update prompts.

To apply updates without being prompted (reusing all previous answers), run:

```sh
copier update -l
```

When [`copier update`][copier-update] is finished, view changes with
`git status` and `git diff`. Resolve any conflicts, and then commit the result.
